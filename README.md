### Instructions For Running the Tests

I used Jest for unit testing.  To install the code to run the tests => ```npm install```

Key files for install to be successful are ```.babelrc``` and ```package.json```

To run all tests =>  ```npm test test/*```

To run individual tests:

1. ```npm test test/todo.test.js```
2. ```npm test test/todo_list.test.js```
3. ```npm test test/todo_app.test.js```
